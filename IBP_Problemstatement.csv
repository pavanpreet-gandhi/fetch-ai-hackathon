Pensioner
50% of member's pre-commutation pension, i.e. 50% of what the member's pension would have been at the date of death if the member had not exchanged any of his pension for a lump sum or to provide a pension for a dependant (in addition to any dependant's pension that would be payable under the Scheme Rules).

Where there is no Qualifying Spouse at the date of the pensioner's death, the initial Qualifying Children's pension will be equal to the Qualifying Spouse's pension which would have been payable had there been a Qualifying Spouse, except that any reduction that would have applied to the Qualifying Spouse's Pension due to age will not apply.  Where a Qualifying Children's pension becomes payable due to the Qualifying Spouse's pension ceasing to be payable, the initial amount of the Qualifying Children's pension will be equal to the Qualifying Spouse's pension previously being paid.

Qualifying Spouse
Pensioner/Deferred Past NRD
Spouse of the member who was not divorced or judicially separated from the member and ordinarily resident with the member at the time of the member's death, provided that the Trustees may at their discretion determine that a spouse who married a pensioner after he or she started to draw his pension and where the marriage occurred within 6 months of the pensioner's death shall not be treated as the pensioner's spouse for the purposes of paying all or any part of the Qualifying Spouse's pension (with the exception being that any statutory minimum benefits required by contracting-out legislation to be paid to the spouse will be paid)."
"With the consent of the Principal Employer, a person who was not the member's spouse at the date of the member's death shall be deemed to be the member's spouse provided that he or she was wholly or partly financially dependent upon the member at the date of death."
""
"Where two or more persons are eligible to receive the Qualifying Spouse's Pension, the Trustees shall either divide the benefit between the persons in such proportions as they think fit, or exclude one or more persons from receiving all or any part of the Qualifying Spouse's pension, as they think fit. 
8.2
Qualifying Child
Pensioner/Deferred Past NRD
A child under the age of 18, or either over the age of 18 and in the opinion of the Trustees suffering from a disability, or over the age of 18 and under the age of 23 and in full-time education approved by the Trustees.  A child will also be either:"
"(i) a natural child of a marriage of the member, or stepchild of the member by virtue of a marriage entered into by the member on or before the Material Date, or"
"(ii) a child of the member legally adopted on or before the Material Date, or"
"(iii) a child legitimised by a marriage entered into by the member on or before the Material Date, or"

"(v) at the discretion of the Trustees, any natural child of the member not born of or legitimised by a marriage of the member."
"Material Date means the earlier of:"
"a) the date the member's pension commenced in payment and"
"b) the date of the member's death"
"The Trustees will divide the Qualifying Children's pension between any one or more of the member's Qualifying Children in such proportions as they shall determine.  In doing so the Trustees will take account of the fact that under the Rules that existed prior to the 17 May 2000 ones a single legitimate child under age 18 would have expected to receive the whole of the benefit, whereas the 17 May 2000 Rules widened the range of potential beneficiaries."
"A pension payable due to disability may be reduced or terminated by the Trustees, if the Principal Employer is satisfied that the Qualifying Child is no longer suffering from a disability.
8.3
Young Spouse's Reduction
